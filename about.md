<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
  Readable Languages is a small, independent publishing house dedicated to helping adult language learners enjoy reading and listening in their target language. We create high-quality, simplified adaptations of classic literature — paired with audiobooks — for learners who want more than just textbooks or teen fiction.
</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
  Our mission is to make <strong>authentic, engaging, and level-appropriate content</strong> available to learners who are ready to move beyond basic vocabulary but still need support to enjoy native-level texts. Each of our books is carefully adapted to the needs of intermediate to advanced learners (typically B1–B2), using natural, modern language while preserving the voice and atmosphere of the original.
</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
  We’re language lovers ourselves. We know how hard it can be to find interesting and meaningful reading material at the right level. That’s why we publish books we’d want to read: <strong>adult-appropriate stories, beautifully adapted, with real literary value</strong>. And because we believe in the power of <em>comprehensible input</em> and <em>extensive reading</em>, we include tools to help learners succeed — glossaries, comprehension questions, and free audiobooks for listening and shadowing practice.
</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
  Whether you're studying in a classroom, learning on your own, or teaching others, Readable Languages is here to support your journey toward fluency — one great story at a time.
</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
  Read. Listen. Understand. Enjoy.
